    <p>Pizza Napoletana, also known as Neapolitan Pizza, is an iconic culinary delight that hails from Naples, Italy. Celebrated for its simplicity, fresh flavors, and traditional cooking method, this pizza is a world-renowned representation of Italian gastronomic heritage.<br>

        The Pizza Napoletana is characterized by its soft, thin, and slightly charred crust, a result of baking in extremely high temperatures in a wood-fired oven. Despite its thinness, the dough is also notably chewy, showcasing the perfect balance of texture that's neither too crisp nor too soft.<br>
        
        The toppings adhere to the principle of minimalism and quality over quantity. A traditional Pizza Napoletana is typically topped with San Marzano tomatoes, grown in the volcanic soil around Mount Vesuvius, giving them a sweet flavor and low acidity. This is complemented with fresh, creamy buffalo mozzarella, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, a scattering of fresh basil leaves, and a pinch of sea salt.<br>
        
        Every bite of Pizza Napoletana offers a harmonious blend of flavors - the sweet tanginess of the tomatoes, the creamy richness of the mozzarella, the aromatic basil, and the smoky hint from the wood-fired cooking process. It's not just a pizza; it's an experience that transports you to the vibrant streets of Naples.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups of 00 Italian flour</li>
            <li> 1 1/2 cups of warm water</li>
            <li> 2 teaspoons of sea salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 can (14 ounces) of San Marzano tomatoes, crushed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Sea salt to taste</li>
            <li>8 ounces of fresh buffalo mozzarella, sliced or torn into chunks</li>
            <li>A handful of fresh basil leaves</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, combine the warm water and yeast, stirring until the yeast is dissolved. Let it sit for a few minutes to activate.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the water and yeast mixture to the flour, mixing until a dough forms.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 2 hours, or until it doubles in size.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the crushed San Marzano tomatoes, extra virgin olive oil, and salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Slice or tear the mozzarella into chunks, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Preheat your wood-fired oven to a temperature of around 900 degrees Fahrenheit (480 degrees Celsius). If you are using a home oven, preheat it to its maximum temperature, usually around 500 degrees Fahrenheit (260 degrees Celsius), and place a pizza stone inside if you have one.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into two portions. On a floured surface, shape one portion into a thin round base. Make sure to leave the edges slightly thicker to form the crust.</li> 
            <li>Spread half of the tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.</li>
            <li>Arrange half of the mozzarella pieces on top of the sauce.</li>
            <li>Carefully transfer the pizza to the oven (use a pizza peel if available) and bake for about 1-2 minutes in a wood-fired oven or about 10-12 minutes in a home oven, or until the crust is golden and slightly charred, and the cheese is bubbling and slightly golden.</li>
            <li>Remove the pizza from the oven, scatter a few fresh basil leaves on top, and drizzle with a little more olive oil if desired.</li>
            <li>Serve the pizza hot, cut into slices.</li>
            
        </ol>
