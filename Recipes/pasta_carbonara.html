    <p>Pasta Carbonara is a classic Italian dish that hails from Rome. It's renowned for its creamy, rich, and deeply satisfying flavor profile. The dish is made from a handful of quality ingredients, such as pasta (traditionally Spaghetti or Rigatoni), guanciale (or pancetta), Pecorino Romano cheese, eggs, and freshly ground black pepper.<br>

        The creamy sauce is made without using cream. The trick lies in whisking the cheese and eggs together to create an emulsion that clings to the pasta, forming a velvety sauce when combined with the rendered fat from the guanciale and the starchy pasta water. Guanciale, cured pork jowl, lends its unique flavor to the dish, but pancetta, an Italian-style bacon, can be used as a substitute.<br>
        
        The dish is finished with a generous sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper, lending a bit of heat and spice. Each forkful of Pasta Carbonara is a delightful combination of chewy pasta, creamy sauce, crispy pork, and spicy pepper, making it a go-to comfort food.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200 grams guanciale (or pancetta)</li>
        <li>400 grams spaghetti</li>  
        <li>4 large egg yolks</li>  
        <li>100 grams Pecorino Romano cheese, freshly grated</li> 
        <li> Freshly ground black pepper</li>  
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the guanciale into small chunks and fry it in a hot pan without any oil. Cook until it's crispy and all the fat has been rendered. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente. Save 1 cup of pasta water before draining.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and half of the cheese. Add a generous amount of black pepper.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is cooked and drained, add it to the pan with guanciale. Mix well to coat the pasta in the fat.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from heat. Pour in the egg and cheese mixture, stirring quickly until the eggs thicken, but do not scramble. The heat of the pasta will cook the egg slightly and form a creamy sauce. If it's too thick, add some of the reserved pasta water.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining cheese, mix well, and check for seasoning. You might need to add a bit more pasta water to get the consistency you want.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, garnishing with more cheese and black pepper on top.</li>
    </ol>
