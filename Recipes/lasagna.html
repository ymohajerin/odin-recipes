    <p> The star of the dish is the meat sauce, cooked slowly to develop deep flavors of tomatoes, ground beef, and a mix of aromatic herbs and spices. The cheese filling, a creamy blend of ricotta, Parmesan, and egg, gives the lasagna its irresistible richness. And finally, the pasta, preferably lasagna noodles, works as a perfect canvas to hold all the ingredients together.</p> 
        
    <p>Each mouthful offers a warm, hearty blend of flavors and textures that make this dish a perennial favorite for family dinners, gatherings, or any occasion that calls for a satisfying meal.

    <p> Remember, like any great dish, the secret to an amazing lasagna is in the quality of the ingredients used and the love put into cooking. Enjoy the process, and most importantly, enjoy your homemade lasagna!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can (28 ounces) of crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/4 cup tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles, cooked according to package instructions</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Additional 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese for topping</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the ground beef, breaking it up with a spoon, and cook until browned. Remove the beef from the skillet and set it aside.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and cook until the onions are translucent and the garlic is fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper to the skillet. Stir well to combine.</li>
        <li>Return the cooked beef to the skillet, stirring it into the sauce. Let the sauce simmer for about 15 minutes to allow the flavors to blend together. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, salt, pepper, chopped parsley, and grated Parmesan cheese. Mix well until everything is thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius).</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Arrange a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread half of the cheese filling over the noodles, then sprinkle with one third of the shredded mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Repeat with another layer of sauce, noodles, the remaining cheese filling, and another third of the mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Finish with a final layer of noodles, the remaining sauce, and the remaining mozzarella. Sprinkle the additional Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Then remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and the lasagna is bubbling.</li>
        <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for 15 minutes before slicing and serving. This allows the lasagna to firm up a bit, which makes it easier to cut into neat squares.</li>
